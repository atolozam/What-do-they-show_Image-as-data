# What do they show? Image-as-data, Berlin-2024

### About the project ###

“What do they show? An analysis of the media coverage of social unrest in Colombia” is a project developed by Juan Carlos Rodriguez-Raga and Andrés Mauricio Toloza Cruz that aims to understand how the Colombian national press and international press depict social strikes in Colombia from 2010 to 2024. To achieve this, we propose two dimensions of analysis: one related to natural language analysis through NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and the second, a comprehensive imagery analysis of the new head image.

This repository collects the different Python codes used during each stage of the project.
